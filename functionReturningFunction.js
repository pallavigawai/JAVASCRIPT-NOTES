/**************** FUNCTION RETURNING FUNCTION ****************** /

Approach:

First call the first function-1.
Define a function-2 inside the function-1.
Return the call to the function-2 from the function-1.

NOTE:-
* Always, when you see such calls f()()(), know: the functions are back !
* Therefore, about any function that returns a function, you can say that it generates a function. It is quite simple to remember, if you hear or read somewhere that functions are being generated, then someone returns them.

* ARROW FUNCTION:- 
  The function definition has the right associativity. Everything that is to the right of =>it is considered the function body .
