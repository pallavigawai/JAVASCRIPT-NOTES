/********************************* HIGHER- ORDER FUNCTION **************************** /

* A Higher-Order function is a function that receives a function as an argument otherwise returns function as output.
* The Javascript Array object which has a lot of higher-order functions which some of them like sort, map, reduce, and filter.
* Higher-order functions help you to manipulate an array as a whole.
 # Map
A map allows you to pass a function that applies to every element of an Array that is why we call it a higher-order function.
The map function does not alter the original array but uses the original array to create a new array that is acted upon by the functions passed on the map argument function.
