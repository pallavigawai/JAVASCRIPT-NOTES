Programming always includes the search for errors. One way to find errors is logging. During program execution, selective outputs are made. To do this in JavaScript, use the console.log function:

console.log('Hello console!');
Here, console.log outputs 'Hello console!'

e.g  
1]Write a function log, that takes a parameter and logs this parameter.
  Example: log('Ken Thompson') should log 'Ken Thompson'.
   function log(name) {
     console.log(name);
    }
    
 2] Write a function shout that takes a string and returns this string duplicated. In addition, the return should be logged.
 function shout(word){
 let result word + word;
 console.log(result);
 return result;
 }
